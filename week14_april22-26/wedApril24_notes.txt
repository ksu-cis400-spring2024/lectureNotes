////////////////////////

//suppose items is an IEnumerable<SomeType>


IEnumerable<SomeType> keep = items.Where(item => (some condition about item));


Or could write:
IEnumerable<SomeType> keep = from item in items 
                        where (some condition about item)
                        select item;



//////////////////////

Example: write method that takes an IEnumerable<Person> (each Person has Name, Age),
minAge, maxAge, firstLetter

Return collection of people whose name begins with that letter and age is in
the specified range


////////////////////

Example (suppose Employee, Student both extend Person)

write method that takes an IEnumerable<Person> 

Return collection of people who are students


////////////////////

Example: how to revise above method to put in alphabetical order by name?
