"Data binding" in Razor pages

Use a form to transfer data from browser to PageModel

Forms have different input elements, notably:
    text
    number
    radio button 
    check box 
    submit (a button that submits the form)


<form>
    <input type="text" name="VarName" value="I have text"/>
    ...
    <input type="submit" value="Submit Form"/>
</form>


Clicking the submit button calls the OnGet method in the PageModel




    also placeholder, min / max (for number type) attributes


/////////////////////////////

Data binding in Razor pages

- bind an HTML form element to a property in the PageModel

<input type="text" name = "MyString" value="@Model.MyString"/>



In PageModel:

[BindProperty(SupportsGet = true)]
public string MyString { get; set; }


//////////////////////////////

Example: see initial form Example

--> how to bind to a string property?

--> what should we do in OnGet? When is OnGet first called?

--> what happens if we try to add each element to a list?
    what happens to the list?

Milestone 11:

- add filters by calories (low/high), price (low/high), keyword

    kids curly

    (should display kids-sized curly fries)

For keyword: split into separate strings

You have a match of all the strings are contained in either:
    - name
    - included ingredients (for entrees)
    - preparation information


How to display filtered results?


Menu

have several filter methods

return: IEnumerable<IMenuItem>

parameters: IEnumerable<IMenuItem>, filter criteria


might want a way to take a collection of items and returns just the entrees

Wednesday: discuss LINQ queries, testing, UML updates
