"Data binding" in Razor pages

Use a form to transfer data from browser to PageModel

Forms have different input elements, notably:
    text
    number
    radio button (also have ischecked attribute)
    check box (also have ischecked attribute)
    submit (a button that submits the form)

<form>
    <input type="text" name="VarName" value="SomeValue"/>
    ...
    <input type="submit" value="Submit Form"/>
</form>


Clicking the submit button calls the OnGet method in the PageModel
