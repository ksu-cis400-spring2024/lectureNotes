Today: Data binding tutorial, part 1
Tuesday: Data binding tutorial, part 2
Friday: Milestone 6

Milestone 6 summary:
    - Update Order class so it can be our DataContext
    - Display the name and price of items in the ListView
    - Display order number, data, subtotal, tax, total 
    - Implement cancel button 
    - Allow items to be removed from the order


--> see demo of Milestone 6

--> this is one of the shorter milestones
--> the two milestones after spring break are the biggest milestones
--> I'll post Milestone 7 before spring break in case you 
    want to start (it will be due the Friday after break)

/////////////////////

Data binding.

- Controls on our front end are bound to data in the back end
- Changing one changes them both

In a control, can do something like:
    Text = "{Binding PropertyName}"

    or:
        Text = "{Binding Path=PropertyName}"


--> control will see if its DataContext has property called PropertyName
    --> if it does, it displays PropertyName
    --> if it doesn't, it displays nothing (no errors)


Remember that different controls *can* have different DataContexts.

If they don't define their own, they "inherit" the DataContext of the
    control they were added to

///////////////////////////////

Example: GUI for voting in an election


--> we want our Election names to be displayed in the ListView

--> we want the total votes to be displayed in the top text block

--> we want the current winner's info to be displayed on the RHS


//////////////////////////////

Step 1: what DataContexts?


Overall?

For the StackPanel on the RHS?

Where should we set them?


//////////////////////////////

Step 2: update click event to cast a vote (how to add name to list?)


//////////////////////////////

Step 3: put data binding in the XAML

    --> ListView
    --> Total votes
    --> Name, Votes count of winner

/////////////////////////////

Step 4: why don't things change?

    --> INotifyCollectionChanged

    --> INotifyPropertyChanged

//////////////////////////////

Step 5: why doesn't the winner change? What is the idea?


/////////////////////////////

What do you need to do with Order?

What will you be binding?


StringFormat=' {0:C}'
