Today: Data binding tutorial, part 1
Tuesday: Data binding tutorial, part 2
Friday: Milestone 6

Milestone 6 summary:
    - Update Order class so it can be our DataContext
    - Display the name and price of items in the ListView
    - Display order number, date, subtotal, tax, total 
    - Implement cancel button 
    - Allow items to be removed from the order


--> see demo of Milestone 6

--> this is one of the shorter milestones
--> the two milestones after spring break are the biggest milestones
--> I'll post Milestone 7 before spring break in case you 
    want to start (it will be due the Friday after break)

/////////////////////

Data binding.

Idea: front end display is bound to back end data. Changing one changes both.



- Controls have a DataContext
- an attribute in a control can be bound to a property in the control's DataContext

In a control, can do something like:
    Text = "{Binding PropertyName}"

    or:
        Text = "{Binding Path=PropertyName}"


--> control will see if its DataContext has property called PropertyName
    --> if it does, it displays PropertyName
    --> if it doesn't, it displays nothing (no errors)


Remember that different controls *can* have different DataContexts.

If they don't define their own, they "inherit" the DataContext of the
    control they were added to

Example: GUI for voting in an election


--> want candidates + vote counts displayed in ListView, with
    ability to cast votes

--> want to be able to add new candidates to list

--> we want the total votes to be displayed in the top text block

--> we want the current winner's info to be displayed on the RHS (eventually)


//////////////////////////////

Step 1: ListView DataContext and items




Where should we set it?


How to display name and #votes?


//////////////////////////////

Step 2: ability to cast a vote for current candidates
    
    --> what to do with button?

    --> why isn't it updating?


//////////////////////////////

Step 3: how to add new candidates?

/////////////////////////////

<--- stopped here, will continue on Wednesday

////////////////////////////


What do you need to do with Order?

What will you be binding?


StringFormat=' {0:C}'

/////////////////////////////

Next time:

Step 4: update total number of votes?

Step 5: how to display the winner?
