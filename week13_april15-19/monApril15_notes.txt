Quickly see solution

////////////////

Begin Razor pages.
- inject C# code into HTML to create dynamic web pages
- will need to add new ASP.NET Core project
    (might need to choose "install more tools and features"
    when adding new project and then search for ASP bundle)

Tutorial 1 : Intro to Razor Pages (due today)
    - create a new ASP.NET Core project, review HTML and CSS,
        see PageModels

Tutorial 2: More with Razor Pages (due Tuesday)
    - read in JSON of movie info, display on a webpage
    - more with styling elements

See: creating a new ASP.NET Core Web App (not MVC, or won't be cross platform)

See: checking .NET version
See: really quickly displaying something by using the PageModel

Milestone 10: due Friday, April 19
- Create a website for Build Your Bowl
- About page, Privacy page
- Home page displays ALL menu options, sectioned by
    Entrees/Sides/Drinks/KidsMeals
    --> also show available ingredients, salsas under Entrees

- Idea: create instance of all (as much as is reasonable...) so they're there
    and ready to search for next week

    Entrees: just create defaults (too many combinations to be reasonable)
    Sides: create all possible combinations
    Drinks: create all possible combinations (EXCEPT Ice customization)
    KidsMeals: create all possible combinations of kids/default side/drink 
        (plus slider combinations). Can keep default counts.

- Example: Street Corn. What combinations?
    cotija cheese - 2 (T/F)
    cilantro - 2 (T/F)
    size (4 - kids, small, medium, large)

    2*2*4 = 16 combinations


- Example: Sliders meal. What combinations?

    cheese - 2 (T/F)
    side - 3 (kid sized fries, kid sized beans, kid sized corn)
    drink - 3

    2*3*3 = 18 sliders meals



Display for each item:
    - Name
    - Preparation Information
    - Price
    - Calories


user should be able to click to go to Entrees, Drinks, Sides, KidsMeals


--> feel free to style however you want! Feel free to look online for CSS examples


--> if you don't like the look of all the menu combinations
- next week we'll be adding search/filters to our menu
- it will be easier if you have a menu with all those combinations
... BUT next week you are welcome to change how things are displayed on the page


////////////////////////

Menu class: FullMenu, Entree, Sides, Drinks, KidsMeals


(some List).AddRange(some IEnumerable);


When you add the ASP.NET web app project, be sure to right-click the 
    build your bowl solution and do Add->New project
