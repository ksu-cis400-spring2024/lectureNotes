Milestone 10: due Friday
    (use .NET 7.0 in Website project)


Recommended order of approach:
- Add About page and edit Privacy page
- Write the static Menu class
- Write the index page to get the menu information to *appear*
- Testing
- UML
- Styling

//////////////////////////////////


Testing: static Menu class

- For each type of menu item (Entrees, Sides, Drinks, KidsMeals):
    --> test that the count matches your expectations
        (leave the expected value as an expression)

        expected value: 2*4 + 

    --> test that the collection contains all expected menu
        items



Assert.Contains(collection, item => (some bool expression about item));


Example: see if "Sides" contains a kid-sized curly fries

Assert.Contains(Menu.Sides, item => item is Fries f && f.Curly && f.SideSize == Size.Kids);


--> be careful when checking for build-your-own bowls and nachos

//this will be true for ANY kind of bowl, even specialty bowls
//need to also check that it is NOT each of the specialty types
Assert.Contains(Menu.Entrees, item => item is Bowl);



///////////////////////////////

Loop through enumerations: 

foreach (Size size in Enum.GetValues(typeof(Size)))


Kids meals:
    create a List of Sides
    create a List of Drinks

    Assert.Contains(Menu.KidsMeals, item => ... k.SideChoice.Equals(s));

would need to override Equals for the sides and drinks

//////////////////////////////

UML:

- add static Menu class (show it is in BuildYourBowl.Data)
    how to show static? (underline)
    any "has-a" relationships? aggregation of IMenuItem
        has an aggregation of IngredientItem

- add each page (Index, Privacy, About, Error) and mark the new namespace
    - look in each PageModel to see any properties/members
    - look for inheritance information
    - what does the Index page *have*?
        aggregation of IMenuItem
        aggregation of IngredientItem

--> relationship between Menu and Index page?
    directed association
    arrow points from Index to Menu


--> don't need Program.cs, _Layout.cshtml, ViewImports.cshtml
