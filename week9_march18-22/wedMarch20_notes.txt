What changes in Order when we customize menu items? How to handle?

//////////////////////

Kids Meals.

- load all side controls into the same grid location 
    (only Fries visible)
- load all drink controls into the same grid location
    (only Milk visible)

Can put radio buttons into a group (only one can be selected)
    with the same ? event:

<RadioButton Name="Button1" Checked="OnChecked" GroupName="Group1">Option 1</RadioButton>
<RadioButton Name="Button2" Checked="OnChecked" GroupName="Group1">Option 2</RadioButton>
<RadioButton Name="Button3" Checked="OnChecked" GroupName="Group1">Option 3</RadioButton>

Write the "OnChecked" event handler, which will run anytime you select a 
radio button in that group.

In the OnChecked method:
    - see which RadioButton was the sender (Button1, Button2, or Button3)
    - what should become visible/hidden?
    - how to change the SideChoice/DrinkChoice of the KidsMeal?
        --> how to get the KidsMeal?

    - what needs to change about DataContext?


--> make sure you invoke PropertyChanged in KidsMeal when 
    changing SideChoice/DrinkChoice

    --> what is affected?

--> attach an event handler to the PropertyChanged event for the new 
    SideChoice/DrinkChoice

    --> why?
    --> where done?
