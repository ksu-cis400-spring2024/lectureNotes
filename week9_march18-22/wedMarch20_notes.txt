///////////////////////

What changes in Order when we customize menu items? How to handle?

Subtotal, Tax, Total 


in Order's Add:

item.PropertyChanged += (my own event handler);

(in our own event handler, invoke PropertyChanged for Subtotal/Tax/Total)

//////////////////////

Kids Meals.

- load all side controls into the same grid location 

- load all drink controls into the same grid location
    

Can put radio buttons into a group (only one can be selected)
    with the same Checked event:

<RadioButton Name="Button1" Checked="OnChecked" GroupName="Group1">Option 1</RadioButton>
<RadioButton Name="Button2" Checked="OnChecked" GroupName="Group1">Option 2</RadioButton>
<RadioButton Name="Button3" Checked="OnChecked" GroupName="Group1">Option 3</RadioButton>


OnChecked event handler (executes when a RadioButton is selected):
    - see which RadioButton was the sender

    - what should become visible/hidden?
        whichever one was checked, the corresponding control becomes visible
        everything else becomes hidden


    - how to change the SideChoice/DrinkChoice of the KidsMeal?

        --> how to get the KidsMeal?
            from the DataContext (it is the KidsMeal we are customizing)
            (the KidsMeal).SideChoice = new whatever one they want


    - what needs to change about DataContext?
        (sub fries control).DataContext = (the KidsMeal).SideChoice;


--> make sure you invoke PropertyChanged in KidsMeal when 
    changing SideChoice/DrinkChoice

    --> what is affected? Price, PreparationInformation, Calories



--> attach an event handler to the PropertyChanged event for the new 
    SideChoice/DrinkChoice

    --> why?
    --> where done? attach event handler

        in the set for SideChoice/DrinkChoice:

        (new side/drink choice).PropertyChanged += (my own event handler);
