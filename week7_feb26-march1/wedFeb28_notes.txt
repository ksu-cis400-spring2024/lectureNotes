Milestone 5 due Friday.



Creating the MainWindow.
    - how to lay out the menu and the order summary?
    - how to get the buttons on the bottom?

    Adding a custom control:

    <local:YourControlClass/>

    (can specify properties like Grid.Row, etc. as usual)


////

What is DataContext? How does it work?
    NOT an Order (at least not for this milestone)
    ObservableCollection<IMenuItem>


Order control should contain a ListView
    - what should our DataContext be?

    - where should we set it?

    <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding}"/>

    What does the "Binding" mean?
