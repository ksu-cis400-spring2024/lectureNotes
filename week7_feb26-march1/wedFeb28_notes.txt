Milestone 5 due Friday.

--> setting the startup project

////

Adding a custom control:

    <local:YourControlClass/>

    (can specify properties like Grid.Row, etc. as usual)

////

What is "DataContext"?

What is "Binding"?


////

Example: ObservableCollection as a DataContext

    --> see code so far 
    --> want to add different names to list
    
    --> what should our DataContext be? how to set?

    --> what to do with ListView to bind it?

    --> what should go in our AddName?

    --> how to display the names?


    (Note: could have used ObservableCollection<string>
    instead of the Person class - but wanted to show
    adding new object.)

////

What will DataContext be for Milestone 5?


Where should we set it?


How many Click events?


How to add correct item to the display?
