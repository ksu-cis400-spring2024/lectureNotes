Milestone 0 due today (Friday, January 19)
    --> also need to post in Discord class channel

    --> set Veggies in GreenChickenBowl to true

////////////////////////

Overall idea of git.

- have a remote repository (this is the URL you copy before you clone)
- can have one or many local repositories on different computers
    - each local repository is connected to the remote repository
    - the remote repository is the "origin"
    - each local repository will have a pointer to an active branch ("HEAD")
    
--> different local repositories might have different "HEAD" values

--> as you checkout different branches in your local repo, the code on the computer
    will change. This does NOT mean you've lost your other code.

--> if you made changes to a local branch, you must make a commit and PUSH it
    to the corresponding remote branch

--> if there are changes in a remote branch, you must PULL them into 
    the corresponding local branch


////////////////

When you sit down to work:

    git status

--> see what branch you are on
--> see if you have any local changes (commit them if you do and want to keep them)


Pull changes from the corresponding remote branch:

    git pull

(will need to set upstream in configurations initially. Can also do:
git pull origin <branchName>)


(git pull only pulls from the current branch. Will need to separately pull
or checkout other branches, if needed.)


///////////////

When you take a break, commit and push changes to current branch:

    git add .
    git commit -m "describe your changes"
    git push

(will need to set upstream in configurations initially. Can also do:

    git push -u origin <branchName>

the -u creates a new remote branch with the same if that branch is new. Isn't
needed if the branch already exists, but doesn't hurt.)


/////////////

Other tips:

- commit and push a LOT!
- stay on a milestone branch until you are completely done. Only then do
    you want to merge it into main

////////////

Work through Milestone 0.

- clone the repo to Visual Studio
- use terminal:
    git status
    git branch ms0
    git checkout ms0
    git status

- add comment line to top

--> fix Calories
    (subtract off ingredient amounts)
    e.g., Chicken is 150 calories

--> fix PreparationInformation
    (add "Hold <ToppingName>" for excluded toppings)


In terminal:
    git status
    git add .
    git commit -m "finished milestone 0"
    git push

        (may have upstream issues)

    git status


Now merge into main:
    git checkout main
    git status
    git merge ms0
    git push

--> check remote repo for ms0, main changes
