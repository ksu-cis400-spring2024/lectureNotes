CIS 400: Object-oriented design, implementation, and testing

Julie Thornton


-----------------------------------------------------------
What will we learn? 
    Creating and maintaining a large software project

1) Object-oriented development principles
2) Desktop development using WPF, data binding, and custom events 
3) Web development using ASP.NET, web forms, and LINQ

Throughout course: writing unit tests, creating UML diagrams





--> big project: developing menu, point of sale, website for "Build Your Bowl"
    (customizable rice bowls and nachos - kinda sorta like Chipotle)

    Part 1: develop menu using object-oriented design principles
    Part 2: write point of sale WPF application for restaurant
    Part 3: create website for restaurant using ASP.NET



-----------------------------------------------------------

Course structure - hybrid.

- Module of work each week:
    - reading (do first)
    - maybe, a quiz or 2 (not for points, but recommended!)
    - 1-2 video tutorials (will start next week - due Mon/Tues)
    - new milestone for the semester-long project (due Fri)

    - this week is a little different


What will we do during class time?
    Mondays:
    Wednesdays:
    Fridays:




----------------------------------------------------------

Software needed.

- Visual Studio 2022 (disable IntelliCode) and Visio (can use another UML tool)


- How to get free versions of both?


- Mac users




- Lab machines




----------------------------------------------------------

Graded work.

Midterm exams (2):      20%
Final exam:             15%
Milestones (about 12):  50%
Activities (tutorials): 15%


Grading scale: 90/80/70/60


Borderline grades.







-----------------------------------------------------------

Class policies.

- Late work



- Dropped exam



- Incomplete



- Collaboration



- Getting help

    --> Helping hand extra credit

-----------------------------------------------------------

Course materials.

- Canvas (see syllabus and modules)


- Online textbook




--> See any typos? Bug bounty.






------------------------------------------------------------

THIS week:
    - Milestone 0 due Fri (finish reading assignment / quiz beforehand!)
        - practice milestone process (git, create release)
        - we will work on milestone together during Friday's class
        - PLUS, post on Discord (can do this now)



Milestone 0.

------------------------------------------------------------

Experience with git? Command line? Branches? Merging? Multiple "local" repos?

C# review.



Write the class Point that represents an (x, y) coordinate. It should include:

- Fields for the x and y coordinates that are only visible inside the class itself
- A constructor that takes values for both fields and initializes them
- The method Midpoint, which takes a second Point as a parameter 
and returns a new Point that is the midpoint between this point and the parameter



////////////

Create Point (2, 4) called p1


Create Point (3, 6) called p2



--> where are these points in memory?

--> can we create a "default" point?

--> difference between field default value and local variable default value


//////////

If we do:

Console.WriteLine(p1);
 

What prints?

//////////

Get the midpoint between p1 and p2 by calling your Midpoint method. 
Store the result in a Point called p3.


//////////

Consider the following Person class:

public class Person {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
 

Create two Person objects â€“ pers1 and pers2. 
    pers1 should represent the person named John Doe who is age 40
    pers2 should represent the person Maria Smith who is age 20.

///////

If we do:

pers1 = pers2;
pers1.Age++;
Console.WriteLine(pers1.Age);
Console.WriteLine(pers2.Age);

What prints?

////////

Create a List called people that can hold Person objects. 
Add pers1 and pers2 to the list


///////

Assume your list has been filled with additional values. 
Print the name of each person in the list whose age is at least 18.
