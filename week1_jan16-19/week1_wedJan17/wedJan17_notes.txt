CIS 400: Object-oriented design, implementation, and testing

Julie Thornton


-----------------------------------------------------------

What will we learn? 
    Creating and maintaining a large software project

1) Object-oriented development principles
2) Desktop development using WPF, data binding, and custom events 
3) Web development using ASP.NET, web forms, and LINQ

Throughout course: writing unit tests, creating UML diagrams





--> big project: developing menu, point of sale, website for 
    "Build Your Bowl" (customizable rice bowls and nachos - 
        kinda sorta like Chipotle)

    Part 1: develop menu using object-oriented design principles
    Part 2: write point of sale WPF application for restaurant
    Part 3: create website for restaurant using ASP.NET



-----------------------------------------------------------

Course structure - hybrid.

- Module of work each week (posted each Friday):
    - reading
    - maybe, a quiz or 2 (not for points, but recommended!)
    - 2 video tutorials (will start next week - due Mon/Tues)
    - new milestone for the semester-long project (due Fri)

    - this week is a little different




What will we do during class time?
    Mondays: lecture/recitation over current material

    Wednesdays: (whatever is left), talk about current milestone,
        get help if needed

    Fridays: help time




----------------------------------------------------------

Software needed.

- Visual Studio 2022 (disable IntelliCode) and Visio 
    (can use another UML tool)


- How to get free versions of both?


- Mac users




- Lab machines




----------------------------------------------------------

Graded work.

Midterm exams (2):      20%
Final exam:             15%
Milestones (about 12):  50%
Tutorials:              15%


Grading scale: 90/80/70/60


Borderline grades.







-----------------------------------------------------------

Class policies.

- Late work
    milestones are due each Friday
    late milestone lose 10% each day they are late 
        bottom threshold of 40% 
    all previous work turned in by the Friday after an exam

    same for tutorials (Mon/Tues)

- Dropped exam (will replace lowest midterm with grade on final,
    if it helps your grade)
    
    2 midterms 
    1 final



- Incomplete



- Collaboration
    tutorials: if you want?
    milestones: should be your own work


- Getting help

    --> Helping hand extra credit

-----------------------------------------------------------

Course materials.

- Canvas (see syllabus and modules)


- Online textbook




--> See any typos? Bug bounty.






------------------------------------------------------------

THIS week:
    - Milestone 0 due Fri (finish reading / quiz beforehand!)
        - practice milestone process (git, create release)
        - we will work on milestone together during Friday's class
        - PLUS, post on Discord (can do this now)



Milestone 0.

------------------------------------------------------------

Experience with git? Command line? Branches? Merging? 
Multiple "local" repos?


-------------------------------------------------------------

C# review.



Write the class Point that represents (x, y) coordinates

- Fields for the x and y coordinates that are only visible 
    inside the class itself

- A constructor that takes values for both fields and 
    initializes them

- The method Midpoint, which takes a second Point and 
    returns the midpoint between this point and the parameter
    (2,4) (4,6)

public class Point {
    private int _x;
    private int _y;

    public Point(int _x, int _y) {
        this._x = _x;
        this._y = _y;
    }

    public Point Midpoint(Point p) {
        int x = (_x+p._x)/2;
        int y = (_y+p._y)/2;

        return new Point(x, y);
    }
}


////////////

Create Point (2, 4) called p1
    Point p1 = new Point(2,4);

Create Point (3, 6) called p2
    Point p2 = new Point(3,6);



--> where are these points in memory? heap
stack: function calls, local variables
heap: dynamically allocated memory (reference types, objects)





--> can we create a "default" point?

--> difference between field default value and 
    local variable default value

    int x;
    Console.WriteLine(x); //compiler error


//////////

If we do:

Console.WriteLine(p1);
 

What prints? Point (would need to override for other behavior)


//////////

Get the midpoint between p1 and p2 by calling your Midpoint method. 
Store the result in a Point called p3.

Point p3 = p1.Midpoint(p2);


//////////

(didn't do rest of page during class)

//////////

Consider the following Person class:

public class Person {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
 

Create two Person objects â€“ pers1 and pers2. 
    pers1: John Doe, age 40
    pers2: Maria Smith, age 20.



///////

If we do:

pers1 = pers2;
pers1.Age++;
Console.WriteLine(pers1.Age);
Console.WriteLine(pers2.Age);

What prints?

////////

Create a List called people that can hold Person objects. 
Add pers1 and pers2 to the list


///////

Assume your list has been filled with additional values. 
Print name of each person whose age is at least 18.
