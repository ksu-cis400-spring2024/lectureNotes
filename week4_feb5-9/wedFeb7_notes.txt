Friday: Milestone 3
    --> check your release!

//////////////////////

Nullables

type? name;

Means name can hold variable with that type, or can be null

will get compiler warning if a reference might be null


value types can be nullable too (it turns them into a reference type):

    int? a = null;



null condition operator

    Dog? d = null;
    d?.Print(); //would call Print only if d not null





///////////////////////

Finish people years unit test

How to choose inline data?

//////////////////////

Kinds of asserts

    Assert.Equal(expected, actual);
    Assert.Equal(expected, actual, precision);

    Assert.True(value);
    Assert.False(value);

    Assert.Contains(expectedItem, collection);

What to test in Milestone 3?

- should have a separate test class for each data class
    - test default values for all properties whose value can change
        (it is OK if you don't test default for preparation information)

    - test any bounds for properties (which ones?)

    - test each derived property based on possible configurations
        which ones?


Example: CarnitasBowl
    Carnitas, Queso, PintoBeans - on
    Salsa.Medium
    Veggies, SourCream, Guacamole - off

    what to do for defaults test?

    any bounds?

    what to do for derived properties?

    how to test preparation information?


Kids meals?
    Defaults?

    Bounds?

    Derived properties?

    E.g., Calories
