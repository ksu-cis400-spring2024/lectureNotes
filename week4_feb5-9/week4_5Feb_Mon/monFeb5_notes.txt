Monday: Interfaces tutorial
Tuesday: Testing tutorial
Friday: Milestone 3

///////////////////////

What goes in an interface?

What is the purpose?

naming convention

//////////////////////

Example: Chicken and Dog

- what if we wanted a list of several chickens and dogs? 

- what do they have in common? how could we refactor?

- how to use?


--> what does polymorphism mean?

//////////////////////

Implementing an existing interface.

- want a set of dogs, sorted by name (SortedSet)

--> what happens now? how to fix?

--> implementing multiple interfaces

--> what are ALL the options of a type that can be used to store a Dog?

///////////////////////

Want AnimalList class
- stores animals in a list
- DogCount, ChickenCount properties
- has a foreach loop

- ICollection

////////////////////////

Implicit casting vs explicit casting

- examples with Dog/Animal

- when must we explicitly cast?


as keyword


is keyword
