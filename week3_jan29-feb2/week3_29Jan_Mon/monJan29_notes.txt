Monday: Methods tutorial
Tuesday: Documentation tutorial
Friday: Milestone 2
    correction: corn dog bites kids meal is $0.75 per additional bite

--> in general, you don't have to document tutorials
(...except the documentation tutorial...)

///////////////////////////

Topics for the week:
- program memory
- objects in memory
- ways to initialize fields/properties
- enums
- decimal type
- uint type
- C# namespace vs folder structure


/////////////////////////

Sections in memory:

- static
- stack
- heap

--> What goes on each part?


--> Can static variables change? Can static memory size change? Memory leak issues?




--> When does stack grow and shrink? Is it limited in size?
    Is memory for ALL value types on the stack?



--> Is ALL memory for reference types on the heap? Is it limited in size?
    When is memory released?



//////////////////////////

--> see Person.cs 

--> want Bob, age 20, lives at 123 Fake St in MadeUp, KS

--> how could we create Bob? What happens in memory?


////////////////////////

Ways to initialize fields/properties at time object is created.

(See Person class)


////////////////////////

When can we do this?

    ClassName obj = new ClassName();

////////////////////////

enums.

public enum SomeName 
{
    Value1, Value2, ...
}



--> are really ints (0, 1, 2, ...). Can be cast to ints in this way.


public enum Soda
{
    Sprite,
    DrPepper,
    DietCoke,
    Coke   
}

--> declare an enum variable, set to Sprite

--> print it (use an interpolated string). What prints?

--> what if it had the value DrPepper? What would print?

--> how to loop through all enum values?

- decimal type



- uint type



- C# namespace vs folder structure
